this is only a concept i put together in a few hours and
i do not know much about cxx so i couldnt optimize it nor make
it work with big files or inputs nor multithread and those juicy stuff
but it was very fun as a learning excercise and working with bytes
and also making a ripoff of the gnu "cat" program kindof, lmao
